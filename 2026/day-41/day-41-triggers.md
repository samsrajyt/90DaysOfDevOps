### Task 1: Trigger on Pull Request
1. Create `.github/workflows/pr-check.yml`
2. Trigger it only when a pull request is **opened or updated** against `main`
3. Add a step that prints: `PR check running for branch: <branch name>`
4. Create a new branch, push a commit, and open a PR
5. Watch the workflow run automatically

**Verify:** Does it show up on the PR page?
Nope its not seen on the PR page

2. Set it to run every day at midnight UTC

3. Write in your notes: What is the cron expression for every Monday at 9 AM?
   cron: '0 9 0 * 1'

### Task 3: Manual Trigger
1. Create `.github/workflows/manual.yml` with a `workflow_dispatch:` trigger
2. Add an **input** that asks for an `environment` name (staging/production)
3. Print the input value in a step
4. Go to the **Actions** tab → find the workflow → click **Run workflow**

### Task 4: Matrix Builds
Create `.github/workflows/matrix.yml` that:
1. Uses a matrix strategy to run the same job across:
   - Python versions: `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`
2. Each job installs Python and prints the version
3. Watch all 3 run in parallel

Then extend the matrix to also include 2 operating systems — how many total jobs run now?

**6 jobs are running in total **

### Task 5: Exclude & Fail-Fast
1. In your matrix, **exclude** one specific combination (e.g., Python 3.10 on Windows)

2. Set `fail-fast: false` — trigger a failure in one job and observe what happens to the rest

**The jobs which progressed were completed and the other jobs were cancelled.**

3. Write in your notes: What does `fail-fast: true` (the default) do vs `false`?
   **If one job failed, all the jobs are cancelled.**
